# Gitlab sync with ldap

- Work tested only with FreeIPA.
Functionality with OpenLDAP and other providers is not guaranteed and may require code modifications.

## Data Synchronization

- Users
  - Are not created automatically.
  - The username is synchronized (From the `displayName` attribute).
  - Admin status is synchronized (Based on group membership).
  - Accounts are blocked (*banned*) if they are removed from the `LDAP_GITLAB_USERS_GROUP` or if their password has been expired for more than 2 days. They are unblocked if the membership condition is fulfilled and the password is not expired.
  - SSH keys are synchronized (From the `ipaSshPubKey` attribute; synchronized keys have the prefix 'FreeIPA managed key').
  - Accounts are deleted if they are no longer present in LDAP.
- Groups
  - Are not created automatically.
  - Membership in Gitlab groups is synchronized based on LDAP groups. Access level is determined by the group name. If `ACCESS_LEVEL` is not specified, `GITLAB_GROUP_DEFAULT_ACCESS_LEVEL` env value is used as access level by default. Default value for `GITLAB_GROUP_DEFAULT_ACCESS_LEVEL` is `developer`
  - Nested groups follow the same group naming rules in LDAP, but all `/` in the group path are replaced with `--`.
  
  ```text
  {LDAP_GITLAB_GROUP_PREFIX}-{GROUPNAME}-{ACCESS_LEVEL}
  ```

  ***gitlab-group-test-owner*** - grants owner permissions in the test group.

  ***gitlab-group-test--nested-owner*** - grants owner permissions in the test/nested group.
